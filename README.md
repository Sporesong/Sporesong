## Hi, I’m Suvi@Sporesong 
- I forgot to upload my latest works to github, so what I did during the summer will show up during august/september here :)
- 👀 I’m interested in travels, art & crafts, coding, fungi, gardening
- 🌱 I’m currently studying to become a front end developer
-  I’m also a mushroom foraging guide and artist
